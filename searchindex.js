These are the three core concepts. Each entity is associated with some components . Those entities and components are processed by systems . This way, you have your data (components) completely separated from the behaviour (systems). An entity just logically groups components; so a Velocity component can be applied to the Position component of the same entity. ECS is sometimes seen as a counterpart to Object-Oriented Programming. I wouldn't say that's one hundred percent true, but let me give you some comparisons. In OOP, your player might look like this (I've used Java for the example): public class Player extends Character { private final Transform transform; private final Inventory inventory;\n} There are several limitations here: There is either no multiple inheritance or it brings other problems with it, like the diamond problem ; moreover, you have to think about \" is the player a collider or does it have a collider?\" You cannot easily extend the player with modding; all the attributes are hardcoded. Imagine you want to add a NPC, which looks like this: public class Npc extends Character { private final Transform transform; private final Inventory inventory; private final boolean isFriendly;\n} Now you have stuff duplicated; you would have to write mostly identical code for your player and the NPC, even though e.g. they both share a transform. This is where ECS comes into play: Components are associated with entities; you just insert some component, whenever you like. One entity may or may not have a certain component. You can see an Entity as an ID into component tables, as illustrated in the diagram below. We could theoretically store all the components together with the entity, but that would be very inefficient; you'll see how these tables work in chapter 5 . This is how an Entity is implemented; it's just struct Entity(u32, Generation); where the first field is the id and the second one is the generation, used to check if the entity has been deleted. Here's another illustration of the relationship between components and entities. Force , Mass and Velocity are all components here. Entity 1 has each of those components, Entity 2 only a Force , etc. Now we're only missing the last character in ECS - the \"S\" for System . Whereas components and entities are purely data, systems contain all the logic of your application. A system typically iterates over all entities that fulfill specific constraints, like \"has both a force and a mass\". Based on this data a system will execute code, e.g. produce a velocity out of the force and the mass. This is the additional advantage I wanted to point out with the Player / Npc example; in an ECS, you can simply add attributes and that's also how you define your behaviour (this is called data-driven programming). By simply adding a force to an entity that has a mass, you can make it move, because a Velocity will be produced for it."},"05_storages.html#storage-overview":{"id":"05_storages.html#storage-overview","breadcrumbs":"Storage overview","body":"Here a list of the storages with a short description and a link to the corresponding heading.

Some code for the drag example to clarify: #[derive(Component)]\n#[storage(NullStorage)]\npub struct Drag; #[derive(Component)]\npub struct Position { pub pos: [f32; 3],\n} #[derive(Component)]\npub struct Velocity { pub velocity: [f32; 3],\n} struct Sys { drag: f32,\n} impl<'a> System<'a> for Sys { type SystemData = ( ReadStorage<'a, Drag>, ReadStorage<'a, Velocity>, WriteStorage<'a, Position>, ); fn run(&mut self, (drag, velocity, mut position): Self::SystemData) { // Update positions with drag for (pos, vel, _) in (&mut position, &velocity, &drag) { pos += vel - self.drag * vel * vel; } // Update positions without drag for (pos, vel, _) in (&mut position, &velocity, !&drag) { pos += vel; } } } Using NullStorage is recommended for marker components, since they don't contain any data and as such will not consume any memory.

How does it speed up the iteration? A hierarchical bitset is essentially a multi-layer bitset, where each upper layer \"summarizes\" multiple bits of the underlying layers. That means as soon as one of the underlying bits is 1 , the upper one also becomes 1 , so that we can skip a whole range of indices if an upper bit is 0 in that section.

Maybe some of them are required, others might be optional and maybe there is even a need to exclude some components? If we wanted to do that using only Storage::get , the code would become very ugly.

This can be fixed by using FlaggedStorage to maintain a sorted Entity list in the System . We will talk more about FlaggedStorage in the next chapter .

To avoid a lot of unnecessary computation when updating components it would be nice if we could somehow check for only those entities that are updated and recalculate only those. We might also need to keep an external resource in sync with changes to components in Specs World , and we only want to propagate actual changes, not do a full sync every frame. This is where FlaggedStorage comes into play. By wrapping a component's actual storage in a FlaggedStorage , we can subscribe to modification events, and easily populate bitsets with only the entities that have actually changed. Let's look at some code: pub struct Data { [..]\n} impl Component for Data { type Storage = FlaggedStorage<Self, DenseVecStorage<Self>>;\n} #[derive(Default)]\npub struct Sys { pub dirty: BitSet, pub modify_reader_id: Option<ReaderId<ModifiedFlag>>, pub insert_reader_id: Option<ReaderId<InsertedFlag>>,\n} impl<'a> System<'a> for Sys { type SystemData = ( ReadStorage<'a, Data>, WriteStorage<'a, SomeOtherData>, ); fn run(&mut self, (data, some_other_data): Self::SystemData) { self.dirty.clear(); data.populate_inserted(&mut self.insert_reader_id.as_mut().unwrap(), &mut self.dirty); // Note that we could use separate bitsets here, we only use one to simplify the example data.populate_modified(&mut self.modify_reader_id.as_mut().unwrap(), &mut self.dirty); for (d, other, _) in (&data, &mut some_other_data, &self.dirty) { // Mutate `other` based on the update data in `d` } } fn setup(&mut self, res: &mut Resources) { Self::SystemData::setup(res); let mut storage: WriteStorage<Data> = SystemData::fetch(&res); self.modify_reader_id = Some(storage.track_modified()); self.insert_reader_id = Some(storage.track_inserted()); }\n} There are three different event types that we can subscribe to: InsertedFlag - will be sent whan a component is added to the storage ModifiedFlag - will be sent when a component is fetched mutably from the storage RemovedFlag - will be sent when a component is removed from the storage Note that because of how ModifiedFlag works, if you iterate mutably over a component storage using Join , all entities that are fetched by the Join will be flagged as modified even if nothing was updated in them. For InsertedFlag and ModifiedFlag , always check that the Component still exist in the storage, and that the Entity is still alive. More on this below. It is also quite important to process RemovedFlag events first if you are trying to keep something in sync with the Specs World . This is because otherwise you might miss synchronization for the following scenario: System runs. Entity with Index X get removed. World::maintain is called. Entity is created and get Index X . System runs. At this point you will get both a RemovedFlag and an InsertedFlag in the same update. If you process InsertedFlag events first you will see \"X is new\", and then RemovedFlag and see \"X is removed\". Now the synchronized state is invalid. The following scenario will also need some consideration: Entity is created and get Index X . Entity with Index X get removed. System runs. In this scenario, if you process RemovedFlag first, the removal event should be ignored because X will not have been synchronized before. It is because of this scenario you should always verify that the Component still exist in the storage, and that the Entity is still alive.","breadcrumbs":"FlaggedStorage and modification events","title":"FlaggedStorage and modification events"},"08_join.html#joining-over-bitsets":{"title":"Joining over bitsets","breadcrumbs":"Joining over bitsets","id":"08_join.html#joining-over-bitsets","body":"Specs is using hibitset , a library which provides layered bitsets (those were part of Specs once, but it was decided that a separate library could be useful for others).

We can also use setup to create our non- Default resources, and also to initialize our System s! We do this by custom implementing the setup function in our System . Let's say we have a System that process events, using shrev::EventChannel : struct Sys { reader: ReaderId<Event>,\n} impl<'a> System<'a> for Sys { type SystemData = Read<'a, EventChannel<Event>>; fn run(&mut self, events: Self::SystemData) { for event in events.read(&mut self.reader) { [..] } }\n} This looks pretty OK, but there is a problem here if we want to use setup . The issue is that Sys needs a ReaderId on creation, but to get a ReaderId , we need EventChannel<Event> to be initialized. This means the user of Sys need to create the EventChannel themselves and add it manually to the World . We can do better! use specs::prelude::Resources; #[derive(Default)]\nstruct Sys { reader: Option<ReaderId<Event>>,\n} impl<'a> System<'a> for Sys { type SystemData = Read<'a, EventChannel<Event>>; fn run(&mut self, events: Self::SystemData) { for event in events.read(&mut self.reader.as_mut().unwrap()) { [..] } } fn setup(&mut self, res: &mut Resources) { use specs::prelude::SystemData; Self::SystemData::setup(res); self.reader = Some(res.fetch::<EventChannel<Event>>().register_reader()); }\n} This is much better; we can now use setup to fully initialize Sys without requiring our users to create and add resources manually to World ! If we override the setup function on a System , it is vitally important that we remember to add Self::SystemData::setup(res); , or setup will not be performed for the System s SystemData ."}},"docInfo":{"09_parallel_join.html#parallel-join":{"title":2,"body":28,"breadcrumbs":2},"02_hello_world.html#components":{"breadcrumbs":1,"title":1,"body":103},"03_dispatcher.html#dispatcher":{"breadcrumbs":1,"title":1,"body":0},"03_dispatcher.html#building-a-dispatcher":{"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2,"body":34},"05_storages.html#storage-overview":{"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2,"body":42},"02_hello_world.html#running-the-system":{"title":2,"body":14,"breadcrumbs":2},"11_advanced_component.html#marker-components":{"breadcrumbs":2,"body":132,"title":2},"03_dispatcher.html#creating-another-system":{"title":3,"body":121,"breadcrumbs":3},"11_advanced_component.html#sorting-entities-based-on-component-value":{"title":5,"body":79,"breadcrumbs":5},"08_join.html#how-joining-works":{"body":44,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"04_resources.html#accessing-resources-from-a-system":{"body":100,"breadcrumbs":3,"title":3},"06_system_data.html#adding-and-removing-components":{"body":72,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":3},"06_system_data.html#default--for-resources":{"breadcrumbs":2,"body":96,"title":2},"08_join.html#excluding-components":{"body":38,"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2},"12_tracked.html#flaggedstorage--and-modification-events":{"title":3,"body":283,"breadcrumbs":3},"10_rendering.html#piston":{"breadcrumbs":1,"body":46,"title":1},"02_hello_world.html#the--world":{"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1,"body":30},"07_setup.html#the--setup--stage":{"body":80,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"03_dispatcher.html#adding-a-system-with-a-dependency":{"breadcrumbs":3,"body":24,"title":3},"05_storages.html#storage-basics":{"body":98,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"05_storages.html#nullstorage":{"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1,"body":36},"05_storages.html#rudystorage--experimental":{"body":15,"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2},"08_join.html#joining-components":{"body":54,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"06_system_data.html#specifying--systemdata":{"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2,"body":56},"01_intro.html#whats-an-ecs":{"title":2,"body":266,"breadcrumbs":2},"03_dispatcher.html#when-to-use-a--dispatcher":{"body":36,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"05_storages.html#vecstorage":{"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1,"body":25},"04_resources.html#resources":{"body":64,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1},"05_storages.html#densevecstorage":{"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1,"body":27},"10_rendering.html#amethyst":{"body":14,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1},"11_advanced_component.html#advanced-strategies-for-components":{"body":13,"breadcrumbs":3,"title":3},"06_system_data.html#draft-system-data":{"body":81,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":3},"08_join.html#joining-over-bitsets":{"body":73,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":3},"02_hello_world.html#setting-up":{"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2,"body":23},"06_system_data.html#accessing-entities":{"body":71,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2},"07_setup.html#custom--setup--functionality":{"body":136,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":3},"01_intro.html#where-to-use-an-ecs":{"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2,"body":39},"11_advanced_component.html#entity-targeting":{"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2,"body":105},"08_join.html#basic-joining":{"title":2,"breadcrumbs":2,"body":65},"08_join.html#optional-components":{"title":2,"body":67,"breadcrumbs":2},"05_storages.html#hashmapstorage":{"body":22,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1},"11_advanced_component.html#modeling-entity-relationships-and-hierarchy":{"breadcrumbs":4,"title":4,"body":95},"03_dispatcher.html#full-example-code":{"body":152,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":3},"05_storages.html#storages":{"title":1,"body":14,"breadcrumbs":1},"01_intro.html#introduction":{"body":67,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1},"02_hello_world.html#hello--world-":{"body":0,"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2},"10_rendering.html#rendering":{"body":41,"breadcrumbs":1,"title":1},"02_hello_world.html#full-example-code":{"title":3,"body":96,"breadcrumbs":3},"02_hello_world.html#the-system":{"body":93,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1},"09_parallel_join.html#basic-parallization":{"body":129,"breadcrumbs":2,"title":2},"05_storages.html#btreestorage":{"title":1,"body":16,"breadcrumbs":1}},"length":51}}};
